// Designed for the same thing as pthread_once: to run something exactly 1 time.
//
// Intended use case:
//   const char *CalculateSomethingCool() {
//     static ::aos::Once<const char> once(DoCalculateSomethingCool);
//     return once.Get();
//   }
//
// IMPORTANT: Instances _must_ be placed in memory that gets 0-initialized
// automatically or Reset() must be called exactly once!!
// The expected use case is to use one of these as a static variable, and those
// do get 0-initialized under the C++ standard. Global variables are treated the
// same way by the C++ Standard.
// Placing an instance in shared memory (and using Reset()) is also supported.
// The constructor does not initialize all of the member variables!
// This is because initializing them in the constructor creates a race condition
// if initialization of static variables isn't thread safe.

  // instead of creating an instance in 0-initialized memory, then this method

  // Get() is called. However, calling it again is not thread safe.
