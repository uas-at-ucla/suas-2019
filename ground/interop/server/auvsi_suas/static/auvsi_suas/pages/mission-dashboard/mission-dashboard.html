        <p><strong>Left Status Pane.</strong> Contains status information about
        the teams which are interacting with the system. A team appears in the
        pane when they are either in-air (TakeoffOrLandingEvent) or active
        (recent interop requests).</p>
        <p><strong>Right 3D Display.</strong> The display pulls data (mission
        config, telemetry, obstacles) from the backend at a regular rate and
        displays it. The display is initially centered at the MissionConfig's
        home position (green sphere).  Additional elements are mission elements
        (white spheres, e.g. SRIC), waypoints (blue spheres), search grid
        (light blue spheres), obstacles (red spheres and cylinders), and UAS
        positions (yellow spheres).</p>
        <h4>System Menu</h4>
        <p><strong>Live View (KML).</strong> Downloads a KML file to view live
        mission and telemetry data in Google Earth.</p>
        <p><strong>Export Data (KML).</strong> Exports mission and telemetry
        data as a KML file which can be viewed in Google Earth.</p>
        <p><strong>Edit Data.</strong> Opens the Django admin page for editing
        raw data, and currently is the primary mechanism for configuring the
        server.</p>
        <p><strong>Clear Cache.</strong> Forces the caches to be cleared, so
        updated are viewed instantly.</p>
        <h4>Mission Menu</h4>
        <p><strong>Mission Dashboard.</strong> Opens this page.
        <p><strong>Review Odlc.</strong> Interface to review object detection
        imagery, review of which must be done prior to team evaluation.
        <p><strong>Evaluate Teams (CSV).</strong> Evaluates the teams on the
        mission and saves a CSV file.</p>
