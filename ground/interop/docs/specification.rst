Interface Specification
=======================

This section describes the interoperability interface that is
implemented by the AUVSI SUAS competition server. Teams should use this
documentation to integrate with the competition server.

Hostname & Port
---------------

The competition will specify the hostname and port during the competition.
Teams will not have this during the development and testing period. For testing
purposes, teams can use the provided competition server to evaluate their
system. The hostname will be the IP address of the computer on which the server
is running, and the port will be the port selected when starting the server.
Teams must be able to specify this to their system during the mission. The
hostname can also be the hostname given to the computer. The hostname
"localhost" is a reserved name for the local host, and it resolves to the
loopback IP address 127.0.0.1. An example hostname and port combination is
"192.168.1.2:8080".

Relative URLs
-------------

The relative URLs (endpoints) are described further in the following sections.
The interface defined in this document is what will be used at the competition.
Only slight changes may be made leading up to the competition to fix bugs or
add features. Teams should synchronize their code and check this documentation
for updates. An example relative URL is ``/api/server_info``.

Full Resource URL
-----------------

The full resource URL is the combination of the hostname, port, and relative
URL. This is the URL that must be used to make requests. An example full
resource URL is "http://192.168.1.2:80/api/login".

Endpoints
---------

Below are all of the endpoints provided by the server, displayed by their
relative URL, and the HTTP method with which you access them.

A quick summary of the endpoints:

* :http:post:`/api/login`: Used to authenticate with the competition server so
  that future requests will be authenticated. Teams cannot make other requests
  without logging in successfully.

* :http:get:`/api/missions`: Used to get details for available missions.

* :http:get:`/api/missions/(int:id)`: Used to get details for a mission.

* :http:get:`/api/obstacles`: Used to download
  obstacle information from the competition server for purpose of
  displaying it and avoiding the obstacles.

* :http:post:`/api/telemetry`: Used to upload UAS telemetry information
  to the competition server. Uploading telemetry to this endpoint is
  required by the competition rules.

* :http:post:`/api/odlcs`: Used to upload odlcs for submission.

* :http:get:`/api/odlcs`: Used to retrieve odlcs uploaded for submission.

* :http:get:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)`: Used to get details about submitted
  odlcs.

* :http:put:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)`: Used to update characteristics of
  submitted odlcs.

* :http:delete:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)`: Used to delete a submitted odlc.

* :http:get:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)/image`: Used to get odlc image previously
  submitted.

* :http:post:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)/image`: Used to submit or update odlc
  image thumbnail.

* :http:delete:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)/image`: Used to delete odlc image
  thumbnail.

Errors
^^^^^^

Some of the HTTP request errors you may receive when using this API:

* :http:statuscode:`404`: The request was made to an invalid URL, the server
  does not know how to respond to such a request.  Check the endpoint URL.

* :http:statuscode:`405`: The request used an invalid method (e.g.,
  :http:method:`GET` when only :http:method:`POST` is supported). Double check
  the documentation below for the methods supported by each endpoint.

* :http:statuscode:`500`: The server encountered an internal error and was
  unable to process the request. This indicates a configuration error on the
  server side.


User Login
^^^^^^^^^^

.. http:post:: /api/login

   Teams login to the competition server by making an HTTP POST request with
   two parameters: "username" and "password". Teams only need to make a login
   once before any other requests. The login request, if successful, will
   return cookies that uniquely identify the user and the current session.
   Teams must send these cookies to the competition server in all future
   requests.

   **Example Request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
      Host: 192.168.1.2:8000
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

      username=testadmin&password=testpass

   **Example Response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Set-Cookie: sessionid=9vepda5aorfdilwhox56zhwp8aodkxwi; expires=Mon, 17-Aug-2015 02:41:09 GMT; httponly; Max-Age=1209600; Path=/

      Login Successful.

   :form username: This parameter is the username that the judges give teams
                   during the competition. This is a unique identifier that
                   will be used to associate the requests as your team's.

   :form password: This parameter is the password that the judges give teams
                   during the competition. This is used to ensure that teams
                   do not try to spoof other team's usernames, and that
                   requests are authenticated with security.

   :resheader Set-Cookie: Upon successful login, a session cookie will be sent
                          back to the client. This cookie must be sent with
                          each subsequent request, authenticating the request.

   :status 200: Successful logins will have a response status code of 200.
                The content of the response will be a success message. The
                response will also include cookies which must be sent with
                future requests.

   :status 400: Unsuccessful logins will have a response status code of
                400. The content of the response will be an error message
                indicating why the request failed. Requests can fail because
                the request was missing one of the required parameters, or
                had invalid login information.


Missions
^^^^^^^^

.. http:get:: /api/missions

   This endpoint is used to retrieve a list of available missions and details.

   **Example Request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/missions HTTP/1.1
      Host: 192.168.1.2:8000
      Cookie: sessionid=9vepda5aorfdilwhox56zhwp8aodkxwi

UAS Telemetry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. http:post:: /api/telemetry

   Teams make requests to upload the UAS telemetry to the competition server.
   The request is a POST request with parameters ``latitude``, ``longitude``,
   ``altitude_msl``, and ``uas_heading``.

   Each telemetry request should contain unique telemetry data. Duplicated
   data will be accepted but not evaluated.

   **Example Request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/telemetry HTTP/1.1
      Host: 192.168.1.2:8000
      Cookie: sessionid=9vepda5aorfdilwhox56zhwp8aodkxwi
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

      latitude=38.149&longitude=-76.432&altitude_msl=100&uas_heading=90

   **Example Response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      UAS Telemetry Successfully Posted.

   :reqheader Cookie: The session cookie obtained from :http:post:`/api/login`
                      must be sent to authenticate the request.

   :form latitude: The latitude of the aircraft as a floating point degree
                   value. Valid values are: -90 <= latitude <= 90.

   :form longitude: The longitude of the aircraft as a floating point degree
                    value. Valid values are: -180 <= longitude <= 180.

   :form altitude\_msl: The height above mean sea level (MSL) of the aircraft
                        in feet as a floating point value.

   :form uas\_heading: The (true north) heading of the aircraft as a floating point
                       degree value. Valid values are: 0 <= uas\_heading <= 360.

   :status 200: The team made a valid request. The information will be stored
                on the competition server to evaluate various competition
                rules. The content of the response will have a success
                message.

   :status 400: Invalid requests will return a response code of 400. A request
                will be invalid if the user did not specify a parameter, or
                if the user specified an invalid value for a parameter. The
                content of the response will have an error message indicating
                what went wrong.

   :status 403: User not authenticated. Login is required before using this

Object Detection, Localization, Classification (ODLC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. http:post:: /api/odlcs

   This endpoint is used to upload a new odlc for submission. All odlcs
   uploaded at the end of the mission time will be evaluated by the judges.

   Most of the odlc characteristics are optional; if not provided in this
   initial POST request, they may be added in a future PUT request.
   Characteristics not provided will be considered left blank. Note that some
   characteristics must be submitted by the end of the mission to earn credit
   for the odlc.

   The fields that should be used depends on the type of odlc being submitted.
   Refer to :py:data:`OdlcTypes` for more detail.

   **Example Request**:

.. http:get:: /api/odlcs

   This endpoint is used to retrieve a list of odlcs uploaded for submission.

   The odlcs returned by this endpoint are those that have been uploaded with
   :http:post:`/api/odlcs` and possibly updated with
   :http:put:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)`.

   .. note::

        This endpoint will only return up to 100 odlcs. It is recommended to
        remain below 100 odlcs total (there certainly won't be that many at
        competition!). If you do have more than 100 odlcs, individual odlcs
        may be queried with :http:get:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)`.

   **Example request**:

   The response format is a list of odlc objects. Each is in the same as
   :http:get:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)` and is described in detail there.

   If no odlcs have been uploaded, the response will contain an empty list.

   :reqheader Cookie: The session cookie obtained from :http:post:`/api/login`
                      must be sent to authenticate the request.

   :resheader Content-Type: The response is ``application/json`` on success.

   :status 200: Success. Response contains odlcs.

   :status 403: User not authenticated. Login is required before using this
                endpoint.  Ensure :http:post:`/api/login` was successful, and
                the login cookie was sent to this endpoint.

.. http:get:: /api/odlcs/(int:id)

   Details about a odlc id ``id``. This simple endpoint allows you to verify
   the uploaded characteristics of a odlc.

   ``id`` is the unique identifier of a odlc, as returned by
   :http:post:`/api/odlcs`. When you first upload your odlc to
   :http:post:`/api/odlcs`, the response includes an ``id`` field, whose value
   you use to access this endpoint. Note that this id is unique to all teams
   and will not necessarily start at 1 or increase linearly with additional
   odlcs.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/odlcs/1 HTTP/1.1

   :status 404: Object not found. Check odlc ID.

.. http:put:: /api/odlcs/(int:id)

   Update odlc id ``id``. This endpoint allows you to specify characteristics
   that were omitted in :http:post:`/api/odlcs`, or update those that were
   specified.

   ``id`` is the unique identifier of a odlc, as returned by
   :http:post:`/api/odlcs`. See :http:get:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)` for more
   information about the odlc ID.

   This endpoint accepts all fields described in :http:post:`/api/odlcs` in
   its request. Any fields that are specified will be updated, overwriting the
   old value. Any fields omitted will not be changed. Specifying a field with
   a ``null`` value will clear that field (except ``type``, which may never be
   ``null``).

   In the example above, only the ``alphanumeric`` field was sent to in the
   request. As can be seen in the response, the ``alphanumeric`` field has
   the new value, but all other fields have been left unchanged.

   The response format is the same as :http:get:`/api/odlcs/(int:id)` and
   is described in detail there.
